# Async-Inn

Using .NET Core and Entity Framework Core, this application serves as a way to get familiar with the MVC application design pattern as well as System Design. The Async Inn is a fictitious hotel that hopes to put all of their record keeping, bookings, and offerings online. Our task is to design a web application for the Async Inn, given their pain points and business needs, using a Code-First, EF Core approach.

## Get Started

In order to get this application started, open up the Visual Studio IDE. Open up the `Async-Inn.sln` and within the GUI, underneath the `Window` dropdown button, click the green play button labeled `IIS Express`. This will compile the program and fire up the local server in your default browser of choice.

The home page offers minimal styling. In order to add to the styles, make modifications to the `StyleSheet.css` located within `wwwroot`, which may be accessed in the Solution Explorer.
